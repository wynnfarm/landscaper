# Materials Calculator Debug Analysis

## 🎯 Current Status

- **API Endpoint**: `/api/calculate-materials`
- **Input**: 20' x 4' wall, concrete block material
- **Container**: Healthy and running
- **Materials**: Loading correctly (13 materials)
- **Material Lookup**: Working correctly
- **Error**: "float division by zero" still occurring

## 🔍 What We Know Works

1. ✅ Database connection and material loading
2. ✅ Material lookup by ID
3. ✅ Wall dimension conversion (feet to inches)
4. ✅ Material dimension handling (null → default values)
5. ✅ Container health and API responsiveness

## ❌ What's Still Broken

1. ❌ Division by zero error in calculation
2. ❌ Error location not pinpointed
3. ❌ Keep rebuilding without fixing root cause

## 🚫 The Loop Problem

- Keep adding logging → rebuild → test → same error
- Not finding the actual division by zero source
- Wasting time on rebuilds instead of debugging

## 🎯 Next Steps (Break the Loop)

1. **STOP rebuilding** - focus on finding the exact error location
2. **Add targeted logging** to each calculation method
3. **Test simpler cases** to isolate the problem
4. **Look at the actual division operations** in the code

## 🔧 Immediate Action Plan

1. Add logging to `_calculate_concrete_block_wall` method
2. Add logging to `_calculate_total_costs` method
3. Add logging to `_estimate_installation_time` method
4. Test with minimal input to isolate the issue
5. Find the exact line causing division by zero

## 📋 Success Criteria

- [ ] Identify exact line causing division by zero
- [ ] Fix the calculation logic
- [ ] Get successful API response
- [ ] No more rebuild loops
